          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>I've lived in the Greater Seattle area most of my life, though I was born in California. When I was an infant, my parents traveled all over the place, including to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. I'm a semi-professional Lindy Hopper, and have been dancing for the past 9+ years. I perform with teams, compete fairly often, travel, and teach occasionally. I'm a huge geek. I love most sci-fi, have an affinity for video games, and keep the occasional anime fandom. The more coding I do, the more excited I get about doing it. I'm stoked to continue learning!
